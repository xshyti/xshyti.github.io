# 🏀 Predicting NBA Game Outcomes: Key Metrics for Regular-Season Wins

> **Author:** Xhoi Shyti  
> **Course:** DSC 680 – Portfolio Project 1: Logistic Regression Analysis of NBA Box Score Data

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses over 70 years of historical NBA box score data to explore which performance metrics best predict whether a team will win or lose a game. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization, we identify the most impactful metrics and develop a predictive model using logistic regression.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify box score metrics most correlated with winning outcomes  
- Develop an interpretable model to predict game results (Win/Loss)  
- Provide strategic recommendations for player development and game planning  
- Visualize key insights in an accessible, presentation-ready format

---

## 📊 Data Source

- **NBA Box Scores (1946–2023)**  
  - Retrieved via the NBA Stats API using a custom Python script  
  - Features include FG%, FT%, 3P%, PTS, FGA, rebounds, assists, turnovers, and final outcomes

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies across decades and standardized formats  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Trends in shooting percentages (e.g., rise in 3P%)  
   - Correlation heatmaps to identify predictive features
3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Focused on efficiency
